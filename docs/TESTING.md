# Testing Guidelines

This document outlines the testing process for the **Telware Cross-Platform** project. Proper testing ensures that our application is reliable, performant, and free of critical bugs. Follow these guidelines to maintain high standards across all features.

## Overview

Testing is a critical part of the development workflow. All code changes must include tests, and the tests must pass before merging into the `develop` branch. The testing strategy ensures compatibility across platforms and helps identify regressions early in the development process.

For more details on the development workflow, refer to:
- [README.md](../README.md#testing)
- [PROJECT_FLOW.md](PROJECT_FLOW.md)

## Testing Setup

Before running or writing tests, ensure your environment is properly configured:

### Prerequisites

1. **Flutter SDK**: Install the latest version ([Setup Guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)).
2. **Dart SDK**: Included with the Flutter installation.
3. **Emulators/Devices**:
   - Set up Android emulators and/or iOS simulators for integration tests.

### Installing Dependencies

Run the following command to install required testing dependencies:
```
flutter pub get
```

---

## Testing Types

We use multiple levels of testing to ensure application quality:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Validate individual functions, classes, or methods.
   - Example: Testing a utility function in `lib/utils/`.

2. **Widget Tests**:
   - Verify the behavior and layout of individual widgets.
   - Example: Ensuring the `LoginButton` component renders correctly and triggers actions as expected.

3. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test the application as a whole, including interactions between components and backend services.
   - Example: Validating the complete login process with API calls.

## Writing Tests

Tests are stored in the `test/` directory. Use the following structure to organize your tests:

```
test/
├── core/              # Unit tests
├── features/            # Widget tests
└── integration/       # Integration tests
```

### Guidelines for Writing Tests

1. **Follow Coding Standards**:
   - Refer to [CODING_GUIDELINES.md](CODING_GUIDELINES.md) for consistent naming and formatting.
   
2. **Use Descriptive Test Names**:
   - Example: `test("should return a valid user object on successful login", () { ... });`

3. **Mock Dependencies**:
   - Use libraries like `mockito` to mock services or APIs during tests.

4. **Focus on Edge Cases**:
   - Test not just typical scenarios but also edge cases (e.g., network failures, invalid inputs).

## Running Tests

Use the following commands to execute tests:

### Running Unit and Widget Tests

To run all unit and widget tests:
```
flutter test
```

### Running a Specific Test File

To run tests in a specific file:
```
flutter test test/unit/sample_test.dart
```

### Running Integration Tests

Integration tests require a connected device or emulator. Start the tests with:
```
flutter drive --target=test_driver/app.dart
```

---

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Test Fails Unexpectedly**:
   - Review error logs and ensure the latest dependencies are installed:
   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. **Integration Test Fails on Emulator**:
   - Confirm the emulator or device is running and has sufficient resources.
   - Restart the emulator if needed.

3. **Flaky Tests**:
   - If a test passes intermittently, check for race conditions or dependency issues.

### Tools for Debugging

- **Flutter DevTools**: Use:
```
flutter pub global activate devtools
```
to install and run Flutter's debugging tools.

- **Logs and Stack Traces**: Check detailed logs for root cause analysis.
